I’m Briana Verdugo, a Mathematical Statistician at the Department of Defense with a background in **economics**, **survey sampling**, and **data-driven policy analysis**.

Before joining the DoD, I worked with the **Bureau of Labor Statistics** and **SANDAG**, gaining experience in labor market research, spatial analysis, and applied econometrics.

I’m passionate about leveraging data to solve complex public policy and workforce problems. My toolkit includes:
- R, SQL, Python
- Excel and Power BI
- Databricks and Advana
- ArcGIS and Qlik

When I’m not working, I enjoy exploring new datasets, learning new data skills, and spending time with my kids.
